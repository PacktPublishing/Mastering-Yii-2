## About the Video Course
With the micro framework Flask, you can take advantage of all the power and simplicity of Python, leveraging it to develop any website or web app imaginable. It makes application development fast, easy, and fun with minimal coding, just what you need. In this course, we will take a look at how to build a web app with all the essential features; after that, the possibilities are endless.

This course covers the essentials of web development in Python. It starts by showing you how to set up an interaction between client and server quickly and efficiently, before moving on to cover how to write templates to allow HTML to interact seamlessly with Python. From there, the course flows into receiving and processing input from your app’s users and grabbing data through web services. You’ll be surprised at the range of functionality you’ll find in a web app that takes only 45 minutes to develop!

Yii is a generic component-based PHP Web programming framework. In addition to being object-oriented, it also features the MVC design pattern. It is a high-performance framework and is used to develop heavy duty web applications quickly. With the rise in the dependability of the Internet, the influx of the users to our websites keeps swelling on a daily basis. Yii is just the right framework to help us cope with this heavy load.

Mastering Yii2 will guide you through rapidly building a sophisticated, secure, and flexible web application. This comprehensive guide will help you to develop and enhance this web application by focusing on a new aspect in every video.

We start by showing you how to set up our version control system using Git so that we can work effortlessly in a distributed team. We will then make our website more responsive using the Twitter Bootstrap framework and then enhance then its security. Then we will store our session data in different storage systems such as the database, Memcached and Redis, and analyze which storage best suits our needs. We will then walk you through step by step adding a full text search using Sphinx, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB NoSQL storage to find the desired data swiftly. Finally, we will take you through making our application robust by testing it with Codeception.

By the end of this course, you’ll be an ace at developing heavily loaded web applications using Yii 2.
